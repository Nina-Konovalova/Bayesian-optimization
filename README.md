# Bayesian methods


This project is based on the idea of using bayesian optimizatian for different optimization tasks:
 - Searching for the local minimum of the Rosenbrock function;
 - Reproducing the parameters of free energy landscape of translocated polymer using the time distribution of translocation.

## Rosenbrock function

The information and instruction can be founded in the folder: [Rosenbrock_function_optimization](https://github.com/Nina-Konovalova/Bayesian-optimization/tree/main/Rosenbrock_function_optimization).

## Landscape tasks

The information and instruction can be founded in the folder: [Landscape](https://github.com/Nina-Konovalova/Bayesian-optimization/tree/main/Landscape).
